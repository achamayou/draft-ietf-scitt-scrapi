      "body": "The current heading says: \"Issue Statement\", which would refer to a document the issuer is looking to create/issue. This is simply a heading change to reflect the service will Sign the Statement on their behalf, differentiating the statement as a payload. \r\n\r\nThe heading and even the API name are another discussion as the doc, as written, isn't clear if it simply returns a signed statement, the client must re-submit under `/entries`, or the `signed-statement/issue` would also register. Based on that discussion, we may want to also rename the API.\r\n\r\n- It's clear why the API would return the signed statement, for the client to hold and attach to a receipt. \r\n- It's not clear why a user would need to re-submit a signed statement, requiring multiple round trips (see #10)",
